    This class is a base class for spawning assets from files. It includes the common parameters
    for spawning assets from files, such as the path to the file and the function to use for spawning
    the asset.

    Note:
        By default, all properties are set to None. This means that no properties will be added or modified
        to the prim outside of the properties available by default when spawning the prim.

        If they are set to a value, then the properties are modified on the spawned prim in a nested manner.
        This is done by calling the respective function with the specified properties.
