    Reads multiple CSV files, identifies 'mean_reward' columns (excluding MIN/MAX),
    calculates the mean and standard deviation across these columns for each step,
    applies a rolling mean for smoothing, and plots them on a single graph.

    Args:
        file_paths (list): A list of strings, where each string is the path
                           to a CSV file containing the robot's performance data.
                           Each CSV file is expected to have a 'Step' column
                           and multiple 'mean_reward' columns (e.g., from different seeds).
        smoothing_window (int): The window size for the rolling mean to smooth the
                                mean reward curve. A larger window results in more smoothing.
