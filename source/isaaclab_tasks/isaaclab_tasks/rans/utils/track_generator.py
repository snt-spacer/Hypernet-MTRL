        Unlike get_curve_tangents, this function will prune a random number of points from the input points tensor.
        The method to achieve this is convoluted, if we were looping around all the tensor elements it would be straight
        forward, but here we want to perform tensorized operations only. Here is a step-by-step explanation:

        To make the code more efficient, the first point cannot be pruned. This is so that it's easy to set the removed
        points to the first point in the sequence.

        1. We first generate a tensor which stores the ids of all the points. We will use this to index the points tensor.
        2. We then need to create a mask with the same shape as the ids tensor, that will tell us which points to prune.
          2.a. We generate a binary tensor of length [num_points, max_points_to_prune] with 1s where the points need to be pruned.
          2.b. We then generate a tensor of shape [num_envs, max_points_to_prune] with the ids of the points to prune.
          2.c. We multiply the two tensors to set the ids of the points to prune to the maximum number of points.
          2.d. We then convert this tensor to a mask by using one-hot encoding and summing along the points dimension.
        3. Apply the mask to the ids tensor, the values to be masked are set to the maximum number of points.
        4. Sort the ids tensor.
        5. Set the ids above the maximum number of points to 0. This is done so that the extraneous points are set to be
        the same as the first point in the sequence. This allows for loops to be created.

        Why do we use multinomial sampling over randint? Multinomial sampling allows us to sample without replacement,
        i.e. we are certain we won't sample the same point twice. This is important because we don't want to prune the
        same point twice.

        Why do we need step 2.a.? Step 2.a. allows us to prune random number of points without relying on sparse tensors
        or loops.

        Note:
        multinomial is faster than argsort(rand) when B > 100. Which is why we use it here.

            points: A 3D tensor of shape [num_envs, num_points, 2].
